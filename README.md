# Python Weibo Scraper
<a href="https://github.com/danqing117/Weibo-Scraper-Python-/blob/master/WeiboCnLogin.py">WeiboCnLogin.py</a> is to log in weibo's mobile page (weibo.cn), and <a href="https://github.com/danqing117/Weibo-Scraper-Python-/blob/master/WeiboComLogin.py">WeiboComLogin</a> is to log in weibo.com. 

I recommend to scrap the mobile page first if you can find all the data you are looking for since the UI is more simply and straightforward.

<a href="https://github.com/danqing117/Weibo-Scraper-Python-/blob/master/weibo_function.py">weibo_function.py</a> is to scrap users' information, including number of post, number of follwers, number of followed, gender, location, birth, introduction, nickname and education. There are two functions inside, "user_scrap_cn" and "user_scrap_com" for scraping weibo.cn and weibo.com respectively.
